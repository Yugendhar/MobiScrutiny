<a name="1"></a><p><b>Q: Why don't you review the ________?</b><br>
<b>A:</b> We would if we could.  We would like to review every mobile phone that comes out - but these days there are more phones than hours in the day.  If you think there is a particular device that we really need to cover, send us <a href="feedback.html" sl-processed="1">feedback</a> and let us know.</p>

<a name="2"></a><p><b>Q: Why do you only focus on phones made by ________?</b><br>
<b>A:</b> We don't.  We review devices from any number of manufacturers.  If one company puts out a lot of models at the same time, maybe it will look that way for a while.  But trust us, we want to cover everything.</p>

<a name="3"></a><p><b>Q: I'd like to write for MobiScrutiny.  Will you send me phones?</b><br>
<b>A:</b> Short answer, No.  Long answer, if you contact us and start writing news pieces and other things for the site and prove yourself to be both capable and reliable, eventually we might decide to send you something to review.  Remember, MobiScrutiny is financially responsible to the manufacturers if the devices get lost, stolen, or damaged.  That means we have to trust you.  That takes time.</p>

<a name="4"></a><p><b>Q: Hah hah!  You made a mistake in your review/newsbrief/world history essay!</b><br>
<b>A:</b> Then please let us know.  But don't be rude about it.  Nobody is perfect.  Cut us some slack.</p>

<a name="5"></a><p><b>Q: What phone is better?  ________ or ________?</b><br>
<b>A:</b> We'd be happy to offer you an opinion, but if you want one, please give us some background.  What is important to you?  Games and ringtones?  Data?  Good looks?  If you don't give us this kind of information, we are gonna pick the device that suits us personally best.</p>

<a name="6"></a><p><b>Q: I can't get something on my ________ mobile phone to work.  Can you help me?</b><br>
<b>A:</b> We can try, but respect the fact that we get a lot of requests for help.  We love to help people because it gives me an additional perspective on the phone in question, but don't expect us to do your work for you.  Use the manual first.  Try to find a solution by searching the web with <a href="http://www.google.com/" target="_blank" sl-processed="1">Google</a>.  Chances are that is the first thing we will do if we don't know the answer.</p>

<a name="7"></a><p><b>Q: I can't configure my phone to do what you did in the review.  Can you help me?</b><br>
<b>A:</b> Maybe.  Just bear in mind that most all of the phones go back to the manufacturer after the review is finished.  So we likely don't have the device in front of us any more to refer to.</p>

<a name="8"></a><p><b>Q: Your review stinks!  The ________ is awesome/lousy!</b><br>
<b>A:</b> You are entitled to your opinion.  We have probably used more mobile phones than you have touched, so I tend to think we have a decent idea of how things stack up.  But if you don't agree, feel free to start your own website and post your opinion there.  If you think you can convince us of the error of our ways, feel free to try.  But don't expect us to change our minds because some stranger says so.  You had better have something to back up your views.</p>

<a name="9"></a><p><b>Q: Why don't you ever mention the prices?</b><br>
<b>A:</b> Because the prices are different everywhere you look.  We will tell you if the phone works.  You decide if the cost your carrier wants for it is worth it.  It is your money, after all.  In our view a lousy phone that only costs $1 is still a lousy phone, and we wouldn't recommend it.</p>

<a name="10"></a><p><b>Q: Can you recommend a ________?</b><br>
<b>A:</b> Maybe.  Ask and see.</p>

<a name="12"></a><p><b>Q: Can you send me all the information you have on the ________?</b><br>
<b>A:</b> No, I can not.  I am not your secretary.  If you have a specific question, ask away.  Otherwise assume that everything we have is on the website already.  Read it.</p>

<a name="14"></a><p><b>Q: When is the ________ going to be available on the market?</b><br>
<b>A:</b> It is likely that I don't really know and probably only have a guess.  Most of the time I have nothing more to go on that what you see in the Snapshots and news items, and that is the information that the manufacturer provides.  Sometimes I might know more if it is a particularly anticipated device.  But probably not.</p>

<a name="15"></a><p><b>Q: Can you sell me a ________?</b><br>
<b>A:</b> We don't sell phones ourselves, but we are affiliated with a <a href="mobiles.html" sl-processed="1">cell phone store</a> that pays us a commission, so it sure would be nice if you bought your phone from there and supported our site.</p>

<a name="17"></a><p><b>Q: GSM or CDMA?</b><br>
<b>A:</b> Well, we like GSM because of the SIM card and the flexibility it offers.  We believe it makes the market stronger when consumers can easily switch to new devices without trouble.  But having said that, we also believe CDMA to be superior technology in many ways.  Consider the 3G standard for current GSM networks; it is called WCDMA.  It is CDMA based.  Not the same as the CDMA 3G systems, but similar.  The CDMA 3G path is also better than WCDMA because it offers backwards compatibility with current handsets.  Similar to what EDGE does with GPRS, but EDGE is just a transitional step to WCDMA.</p>

<a name="18"></a><p><b>Q: PocketPC or PalmOS?</b><br>
<b>A:</b> For me, PocketPC.  For you, maybe PalmOS.  PocketPC offers more flexibility and power than PalmOS devices, but it is not as stable in general.  Most people just need a date book and address book and PalmOS is great for that.  But I believe that the Microsoft platform is inherently more powerful, and that Palm's future is rather bleak.  These days there are plenty of great Symbian based devices out there as well, and Google's Android is likely to be a big player in the future with its Linux based system.</p>
